You are more than welcome to create a pull request to fix a bug or a new feature.

## Style ##

The codebase uses [.net core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md) coding style. 

Try to keep lines of code around 100 characters in length or less, though this is not a hard limit.
If you're a few characters over then don't worry too much. 

**DO NOT USE #REGIONS** full stop.

## Pull requests ##

A single pull request should be submitted for each change. If you're making more than one change,
please submit separate pull requests for each change for easy review.
